**_The teleprompter can only read txt files._**

A VERY BASIC display app (teleprompter) that prompts the person speaking with an visual text of a scripts.  On android / apk build you can copy and paste your desire text and use it on the teleprompter; the desktop build will also allowed you to copy and paste your text and it will let you look for any txt file on your drive.

You can scroll the text with your finger or use a gamepad with Bluetooth connection.

When using a gamepad to control the scroll you can "Scroll Up" using the D-Pad Up, D-Pad Left, Left Stick Up and Left Stick Left; to "Scroll Down" use D-Pad Down, D-Pad Right, Left Stick Down and Left Stick Right.

Future update will try and aim at Mac OS, iOS and iPad OS
